# deep_learning_for_advanced_facial_recognition

This project explores applying deep learning techniques in facial recognition and bounding box prediction, utilizing a modified MobileNetV2 architecture for enhanced performance in real-time applications. By integrating the MobileNetV2 model with custom dense layers for classification and bounding box predictions, we aimed to develop a robust system capable of accurately identifying and locating faces within images. The dataset comprised diverse facial images divided into training, validation, and test sets to train and evaluate the model. Testing and real-time prediction results demonstrate the model's potential, achieving high accuracy and precision in classification and localization tasks. This report outlines the methods, experiments, and results obtained and comprehensively analyzes the project's relevance, usefulness, soundness, and clarity. The findings highlight the potential of deep learning in transforming facial recognition technologies and suggest methods for future enhancements.
